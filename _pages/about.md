Thank you for visiting my website! I am a PhD student in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. I joined the [ACE group](https://www.elizabethqian.com/research/ace-group) in fall 2023 and have been working with Dr. [Elizabeth Qian](https://www.elizabethqian.com/) since then. Before joining the ACE group, my work mainly focused on the application of reduced-order models/surrogate models to various engineering problems. My current research takes a methodology development perspective, with a primary focus on multifidelity machine learning.
